Only USA

Only JSON

We need to implement an endpoint (Echo Framework) that, given a list of cities, returns a list of forecast for those cities:

/weather?city=los%20angels,%20new%20york,chicago

For each single city we would like to know the daily forecast plus the forecasts of the next 2 days (72h)

Hints:

    in order to convert a string (New York) in a pair of coordinates (40.71427, -74.00597) you can use this service https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search?q=new%20york,usa&format=json - (Json marshal/unmarshal), structs and json tags (-, omitempty)... 

    in order to get the forecast of a pair of coordinates you can use this service https://api.weather.gov/points/40.71427,-74.00597 -> `properties`` -> `forecast` (this is a URL) -> make another request -> `properties` -> `periods`
    the forecast for the day comes back in different "periods" ... Check the first and more, if its the current time if its not discard... and accept any that are now or later (under 72h - 2 days)

What we would like to see

    1 .tiny service that works just fine (that we can launch it ideally via docker or command line).
    2. thoughtful design & tests.
    3. implement a file cache (memory or file based) system without using any framework.
    ~ ReadMe file with the instructions for using the service.

Echo framework (server)
Client -> to make http GET requests -> To any links mentioned/needed
A lot of Json to Structs

Sending out the response ->
